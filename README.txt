To use bash script, script must be in the same folder as 1.2, 2.1, and 3.1

The bash script takes 2 arguments
To run the bash script, the arguments must be name of the input file and output file without the .txt extension

The script will output 3 files ending in "x_tokenlist," "x_ast," and "x_output."  The "x" signifying the name of the output file specified.

Our program was created and tested using repl.it.

example:
sh BashScript.sh <input file name> <output file name>
